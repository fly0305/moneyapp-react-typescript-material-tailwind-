##  ✍️ How are charts getting updated - Architecture approach
1. `GlobalDatePicker` from `Dashboard` updates the `Reactive variables` date-range (aka `startDate` and `endDate`)  stored in `Apollo client`
3. Custom chart wrapper (e.g, `IncomeByPaymentMethod` which uses `LineChart.tsx`) takes date-range (`reactive variables`) from apollo client and populate them into their own `gql` queries as arguments
4. Custom chart wrappers pass down fetched & processed data (`labels` and `values`) into `pure chart components`
5. Each pure chart components populate data (no manual calculation involved)
6. All chart wrapper that use `reactive variables` will update queries (so will charts update) whenever date-range changes in `Apollo client` store
