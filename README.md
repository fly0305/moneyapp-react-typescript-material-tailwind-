##  ✍️ How are charts getting updated - Architectural approach
| No. | Steps
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | `GlobalDatePicker` from `Dashboard` updates the `Reactive variables` date-range (aka `startDate` and `endDate`)  stored in `Apollo client` |
| 2 | Custom chart wrapper (e.g, `IncomeByPaymentMethod` which uses `LineChart.tsx`) takes date-range (`reactive variables`) from apollo client and populate them into their own `gql` queries as arguments
| 3 | Custom chart wrappers pass down fetched & processed data (`labels` and `values`) into `pure chart components`
| 4 | Each pure chart components populate data (no manual calculation involved)
| 5 | All chart wrapper that use `reactive variables` will update queries (so will charts update) whenever date-range changes in `Apollo client` store
