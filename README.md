##  ‚úçÔ∏è How charts getting updated - Architecture approach
1. `Dashboard` passes down date-range (`startDate` and `endDate`) to specified chart components as props
2. Charts receive date-range as props from Dashboard
3. Each chart populates date range into `gql` query
4. The new `gql` query will be used to call data from API using `useQuery` from `Apollo`
5. The returned query response will be extracted and modified to fit chart type within each chart component
